### Kafka
1. Kafka is run as a cluster on one or more servers.
1. The Kafka cluster stores streams of records in categories called topics.
1. Each record consists of a key, value, and a timesstamp.

- Each topic consists of multiple partitions.
  - allow the log to scale horizontally
  - act as the unit of parallelism.
- Sequencial id number in each partition is called **offset** which uniquely identifies each record within the partition.
- The Kafka cluster durably persists all published records.

#### Distribution
- Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance.
- Each partiion has one server acts as the "leader" and zero or more as "followers".

#### Consumer
- Consumer label themselves with a *consumer group* name.
  - Each record published to a topic is delivered to one consumer instance within each subscribing consumer group.
  - Consumer instances could be in separate processes or on separate machines.

#### Kafka as  Messaging system
Mainly two Models
1. queuing
1. publish-subscribe
Kafka bears both of these two characteristics

#### Kafka as a storage system
Every record is written to disk and duplicated for fault-tolerance.

#### Kafka for stream processing
- Stream processor
