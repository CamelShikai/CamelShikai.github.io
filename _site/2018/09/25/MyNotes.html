</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Each topic consists of multiple partitions.
    <ul>
      <li>allow the log to scale horizontally</li>
      <li>act as the unit of parallelism.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sequencial id number in each partition is called <strong>offset</strong> which uniquely identifies each record within the partition.</li>
  <li>The Kafka cluster durably persists all published records.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="distribution">Distribution</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance.</li>
  <li>Each partiion has one server acts as the “leader” and zero or more as “followers”.</li>
</ul>
